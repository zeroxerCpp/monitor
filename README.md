first use upm i.

this is a shell for monitor the balance of the address.
for example,to monitor the USDC of Eralend,you just need to run balanceUtil.js.
Once the number of balance of USDC changed,the monitor will show it on terminal.
If you need to monitor other addresses and other tokens,just define it.
